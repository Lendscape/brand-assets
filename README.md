## Typography
**Sulphur Point** is the primary type family of Landscape brand identity system. It's a Sans Serif typeface with a modern and minimal look. It's simple and easy to read. We use three different weights to create hierarchy and consistency in designs and documents.

You can find our typography `ttf` files in the [`/assets/font/`](./assets/font/) directory.
